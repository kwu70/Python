# Python
Place to store python related materials and projects

This repository is for storing stuff on my journey to learning python. 

Took Stanford online course of CS106A called Code in Place from April 13th to May 22nd.
This is a slightly shorter version than the regular CS106A class, 
but it covers over all the necessary materials for learning Python. 

After the class is over, the plan is to learn machine learning and implement projects on this journey.
